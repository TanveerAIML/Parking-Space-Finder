# Parking-Space-Finder

A Parking Space Finder is a system that uses various technologies to automatically count the number of vehicles parked in a designated area, such as parking lot or a parking garage. The system typically includes cameras and image processing software that can identify and track vehicles as they enter and exit the parking area. The data is then used to provide real-time information about the numberof available parking spaces, which can be displayed on a moniter or website for the public to view. The system can also store data on a parking usage over time to help identity paterns and trends in parking demand.

There are different types of parking space finder but this project is based on video-based system. It uses cameras to capture the images of the paarked cars, then the system use image processing techniques to detect and track the cars and provide the count.
